## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

![Network Diagram](images/ELK-Diagram.drawio.png)


These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the playbook file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing makes sure that the application will be highly available, in addition to restricting inbound access to the network.
The load balancer makes sure that incoming traffic will be shared by both vulnerable web servers. Access controls will ensure that only authorized users will be able to connect in the first place.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the file systems of the VM's on the network and system, watch system metrics, CPU usage, attempted SSH logins, sudo escalation failures and more.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
_Note: Use the [Markdown Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to add/remove values from the table_.

| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway  | 10.0.0.1   | Linux            |
| WEB 1    |Web Server| 10.0.0.5   | Linux            |
| WEB 2    |Web Server| 10.0.0.6   | Linux            |
| ELK      |Monitoring| 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the jump box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses: 47.28.3.124

Machines within the network can only be accessed by each other.
The Web Server 1 and Web Server 2 send traffic to the ELK server. 
Web 1: 20.24.212.150
Web 2: 20.24.212.150

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes                 |    47.28.3.124       |
| ELK      | No - Port 5601      |    10.0.0.1-254      |
| WEB 1    | No                  |    10.0.0.1-254      |
| WEB 2    | No                  |    10.0.0.1-254      |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because less chance of human error, automating saves time, makes it easy to deploy in other environments. 

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- Installs docker.io
- Installs pip3
- Installs Docker python module
- Downloads and launches a docker elk container
- Enables the service docker on boot

- Installs and Lanches Filebeat 
- Downloads the filebeat .deb file from the Kibana server
- Enables and Configures system module
- Setup filebeat
- Starts filebeat service
- Enables service on boot

- Installs metric meat
- Enables and configures docker module for metric beat
- Starts metric beat
- Enables service on boot


The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
WEB 1 and WEB 2 VM's, at 10.0.0.5 and 10.0.0.6

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- _TODO: Specify which Beats you successfully installed_

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- _TODO: In 1-2 sentences, explain what kind of data each beat collects, and provide 1 example of what you expect to see. E.g., `Winlogbeat` collects Windows logs, which we use to track user logon events, etc._

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. We use the Jump-Box-Provisioner for this. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the playbook file to ansible control node.
- Update the hosts file to include groups and IP's
- Run the playbook, and navigate to Kibana to check that the installation worked as expected.

Go to http://20.211.104.97:5601/app/kibana#/home

Command to download the playbook:
curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat/filebeat-7.6.1-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz
tar xzvf filebeat-7.6.1-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz
cd filebeat-7.6.1-darwin-x86_64/
